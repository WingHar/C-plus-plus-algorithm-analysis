# C-plus-plus-algorithm-analysis
A comparison of Heap, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort written in C++.

Description of the project:
---------------------------
Write a C++ program that compares the execution times of Heap, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sorts for inputs of different sizes. The time, in seconds, must be formatted with at least two decimal numbers.
First, we must randomly generate inputs of different sizes, bt the "same input" generated, must be applied to the three. However, the random inputs must be copied to three different arrays, one for each sort, to make sure that they are not previously sorted by another sorting technique.
